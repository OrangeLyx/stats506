This repository contains the raw code and experiment files used for the project. Because the analysis involves a large number of exploratory attempts, I separated the scripts and retained intermediate and failed experiments for transparency and reproducibility. After comparing the performance of several approaches—including PSM, logistic regression, and various statistical tests—I selected three representative methods for the final report: Chi-squared tests, Difference-in-Differences (DID), and LASSO regression. These methods best illustrate the key patterns and relationships within the constraints of a three-page report, though additional extensions could be explored with more space.
