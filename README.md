# STAT 506 Code Archive

Welcome! 👋  
This repo is a collection of everything I wrote for **STAT 506** — homeworks, and my final project.

### What's Inside?

- `project/` — all final project code + report  
- `set/` — weekly homework

The project folder includes many trial-and-error scripts. I kept them to show the full workflow and learning process.

### Final Project Methods
I tested many approaches, but the final write-up focuses on:
- Chi-square  
- DID  
- LASSO  

Enjoy browsing!
